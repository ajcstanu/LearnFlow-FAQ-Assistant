# 🤖 Automated FAQ Agent using Lyzr.ai

This project presents an AI-powered FAQ agent built with **Lyzr.ai** to handle repetitive queries related to course schedules, syllabus, and the enrollment process for an educational platform called **LearnFlow**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

LearnFlow receives a high volume of repetitive questions via their website's chat widget. These include:

- Course start dates and timings  
- Syllabus structure  
- Enrollment and payment process  

To improve efficiency and user experience, we designed an automated solution.

## 🛠️ Solution Overview

We developed a smart FAQ Agent using **Lyzr.ai** that:

- **Understands user intent** through intent recognition  
- **Fetches relevant answers** from a structured **Knowledge Base**  
- **Maintains conversational flow** to engage users naturally  
- Can be **integrated into any website chat widget**

## 🔧 Key Components Used

- **Knowledge Base:** Contains structured FAQs and responses related to LearnFlow’s offerings.  
- **Intent Recognition:** Detects what the user is asking (e.g., "When do classes start?").  
- **Conversational Flow:** Ensures smooth transitions between questions and answers.  
- **Lyzr Studio:** Used to design, test, and deploy the agent.

## 🧠 Training the Agent

The agent was trained using:

- A manually curated list of frequently asked questions  
- Structured answers for each intent  
- Sample user utterances to improve intent detection  

## 🌐 Integration

The agent is ready to be integrated into any website chat widget using Lyzr’s deployment options (iframe, JS snippet, etc.).
